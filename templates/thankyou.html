              <p> I am an engineer and I love to make impossible possible using my engineering skills. My hobby in sketching and love towards mathematics drive me towards engineering. I believe the language of maths and geometry can be building blocks to solve barriers around us.
              </p>
              <p>I have fond for designing and solve problem in creative way. As a Mechatronics master student specialised in Cyber physical system my motive of study is to make life easier by automating things around. Use of machine learning algorithms and deep learning to model. My career dream is to use my expertise in Industry 4.0 design.</p>
              <p> Creativity and innovation to design new models or modify existing to produce more simpler but powerfull is my passion. Choosing Robotics and other high end technologies to gain wisdom was my path for pursuing my passion.</p>

              <p>AR and VR are the high end technologies where reality is simulated virtually. The application of AR for entertainment as well as information simultaneously for simulating virtual world is studied. Use of unity hub for rendering 3d models to give functions in real world. Capturing 3d visuals and converting them to 3d models and simulating them in reality is interesting as  well as futuristic. An entire real life risk situations simulation, prototyping, testing designs in an informatics way to convey ideas very easily was my case study content. As an example Augmented reality in the field of journalism was implemented using Unity hub platform. I came to know AR is one of the best way to provide very precise information very productive and impressive way.</p>

              <p>Additive manufacturing/ 3d printing is one of the production technologies we can use in cyber physical production. 3d printing is used to produce complex parts with individual customisation in a very fast way. 3d CAD models designed in CAD tools are sliced into layer digitally and printed layer by layer using a 3d printer.  By the design modification and adjusting part orientation we can  minimise supporting structure. If the situation of avoiding support structure is inevitable or the surface is not smooth, post processing will be required. Different methods for post processing are analysed and categorised based on models and the AM technologies used in 3d printer. 3d printer types, technologies , material used and 3d models influences end products surface smoothness.</p>

              <p>Predictive analysis is one of the best tool for optimum production planning. Machine learning algorithms and deep learning are powerful way to predict data based on relevent data base. Regression as well as classification are discussed in the case study. Regression analysis layer by layer is done using Matlab and tensor-flow. The model  is used to analyse the trend of sensor data of machines to predict next possible maintenance time. By using ML the downtime of the machine in an industry is predicted. The modelling of the system was the key point in the case study.</p>

                  <p>Designed a preclinical demonstrator for real-time detection of seizure based on various body sensors. The Embedded System consist of a microprocessor (ARM Cortex M4) along with heart rate sensor, body
temperature sensor and ectodermal sensor acts independently without the help of any peripheral device and inform the dependent during the activity of seizure. It also collects details as a log during the seizure which assists the doctor during patients diagnosis. The band is compact and specially designed for epilepsy patients. The Data collected using the sensors will be used to check the trend during the siezure and predict the future incident to be happened by creating individualised algorithm. </p>
